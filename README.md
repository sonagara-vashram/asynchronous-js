# Asynchronous JavaScript - Basics

This repository is designed to help beginners understand the basics of Asynchronous JavaScript. You will find simple examples, explanations, and use cases for concepts such as **callbacks**, **promises**, and **async/await**.

## What is Asynchronous JavaScript?

Asynchronous JavaScript allows us to execute long-running tasks like fetching data from a server or processing large datasets without blocking the main thread, which keeps our application responsive and efficient. This repo will help you learn how to handle such tasks in a structured way.

## Topics Covered

1. **Synchronous vs Asynchronous Code**  
   Understanding the difference between synchronous (blocking) and asynchronous (non-blocking) execution.

2. **Callbacks**  
   Introduction to callback functions and how they are used to handle asynchronous tasks.

3. **Promises**  
   Learn how promises are used to handle asynchronous operations in a more structured way than callbacks.

4. **Async/Await**  
   Modern and easy-to-read way of writing asynchronous code using `async` and `await`, **etc..**
